                                    After ReactJS, I am diving into another sea of new knowledge in NextJS. To be honest, the time the technical manager 
                                    mentioned NextJS was the first time I heard about it. Since I already learned about ReactJS, I thought this was going 
                                    to be an easy lesson. <br><br>
                                    Based on the notes I have written; these are the items/terms that piqued my interest since it was my first time hearing 
                                    and seeing them:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>getStaticProps</li>
                                    <li>getServerSideProps</li>
                                    <li>getStaticPaths</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The lesson created another app but I want to stick with the sample project I did with ReactJS. This way, I could do a 
                                    comparison on both libraries. I created a sample app that allows me to view, add, and delete photocards but only in text 
                                    form. Since I was aiming to create the same sample app with ReactJS, I also used JSON Server to retrieve, add, and 
                                    delete photocards.<br>

                                    The routing for NextJS though was much, much easier compared to ReactJS. It is like using an &lt;a&gt; HTML tag. This already 
                                    made me lean more towards NextJS. Since the draft <b>INTO</b> app has lots of routing, I want to use a library that would 
                                    not give me more difficulties. <br><br>
                                    Finally, I think I will be using NextJS to develop <b>INTO</b>.
