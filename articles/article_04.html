                                    After learning both ReactJS and NextJS, and deciding that NextJS is the chosen one to be used in the development. The 
                                    draft has already been laid out and it is time to add more features needed for <b>INTO</b>. <br><br>
                                    I started creating the user interface by getting inspirations from Shopee.<br>

                                    However, there was something lacking. Of course! A project name or brand needs to be present! If you have read my 
                                    home page, you would have known how I came up with the brand name. If you did not read my home page, I will give you 
                                    time to do so. You have got 5 minutes then come back here to continue reading. <i>Are you done? Okay! Let us proceed!</i> So, 
                                    my brand name is <b>INTO</b>. I felt so excited when I came up with the name! I immediately thought of a logo and of course, 
                                    created them. It took me 2 days to create the logo which satisfied myself.<br>

                                    After the planning, I shared the knowledge I have gained and introduced the personal project I want to work on. The project 
                                    manager’s response encouraged me to continue <b>INTO</b>. I was also assigned to create a GitHub Pages to document the project’s 
                                    progress aaaaand this is it. I am about to start creating the <b>INTO</b> app… Are you ready? I am not, just kidding! 
                                    I am <i>kind of</i> ready!
