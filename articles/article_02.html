                                    Day 1! Learning ReactJS. First, I thought I could easily recycle the sample project that I made last year when the senior 
                                    software developer had shared his knowledge and taught us React. Apparently, upon diving more into the lesson, I quickly 
                                    observed that the syntaxes were different. I was shocked! Then, I realized, what we learned last year was React <b>Native</b> 
                                    and what I am learning right now is React<b>JS</b>. The names are similar so why don’t we differentiate them? <br><br>
                                    Framework vs Library. React Native is an entire framework while ReactJS is a JavaScript library. What does this mean? 
                                    Difference of control. You control a library, but the framework controls you. Also, since React Native is an entire framework, 
                                    it is used to develop cross platform applications. <br><br>
                                    Based on the notes I have written; these are the items/terms that piqued my interest since it was my first time hearing and 
                                    seeing them:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>useState</li>
                                    <li>useEffect</li>
                                    <li>useContext</li>
                                    <li>useReducer</li>
                                    <li>useRef</li>
                                    <li>JavaScript Syntax eXtension (JSX)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    I followed the lesson of creating a simple app that can view, add, and delete items. The sample app was a to-do app where you 
                                    can view a list of your to-do tasks, you can add a task, and delete a task. Since I already have thought of a sample project, 
                                    I modified it to fit my sample project. Instead of creating a to-do app, I created a sample app that allows me to view, add, 
                                    and delete photocards but only in text form.<br>

                                    Aside from learning about ReactJS, I also learned using JSON Server. I was really amazed! It was my first time using JSON server
                                    as a mock REST API. It was easy to setup and easy to use. <br><br>
                                    I know this was just a simple app, but it did introduce me to ReactJS. What do I think about ReactJS? I think it is good but the 
                                    struggle I went through just to do the routing… It was stressful. It took me about 4 hours and couple more research to make the 
                                    routing work. I was forced to view the old React Native lesson and check how the routing was done. It was totally different. I 
                                    think this is one of the disadvantages of just using a library instead of a framework. Nevertheless, I did have fun learning 
                                    new things and a new library for my frontend skills.
