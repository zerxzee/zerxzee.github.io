                                    As part of the company’s goal to achieve global competitiveness, employees were required to create their own Object Key Results (OKRs). 
                                    It took time for me to identify what I want to do for my OKRs. I started with identifying easy OKRs to add. With the help of our technical 
                                    manager, he was able to suggest learning ReactJS and NextJS for my OKRs. <br><br>
                                    Learning something new always scares me especially now that I have been doubting myself and my skills these days. For 2 years, I only focused 
                                    in Angular and Typescript. With the OKR, I am about to dive into the world of React, ReactJS, NextJS, and JavaScript. I may have the basics laid 
                                    out, but I do not have trust in myself. Lol. But of course, to cross the canyon, I need to take the first step which is literally jump! <br><br>
                                    But! Eeeeeeeven before taking the jump though, I need to prepare… I wanted to have a personal project to work on since I have not had one since, 
                                    well, since college, I guess. I wanted to create a personal project using what I will be learning from the adventure of achieving my OKRs. <br><br>
                                    What do I want to do? What do I want to create? What am I <b>INTO</b>? Suddenly, it hit me! I currently have trouble sleeping early these days because I 
                                    am into window shopping! And no, I am not talking about Shopee, Lazada, Zalora, etc. I am talking about window shopping in Twitter! Yes, Twitter. 
                                    Just like Facebook, Twitter is now not only used as a social media but also an online marketplace. However, it is a real struggle to find specific 
                                    items since the soul searcher must be able to enter the appropriate keywords. I am thinking, how about I make my fellow rupok friends’ lives easier? 
                                    How about creating an app that is exclusive for photocards only? An app that allows the users to sell, buy, and showcase their collection? This is 
                                    when an idea was born.
